# AHP Simulation

This project is an implementation of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions. The project includes a web-based interface that allows users to input values, manage data, and perform various operations such as exporting to Excel, resetting, undoing, saving, and restoring data.

### Key Features:

- **User Interface**: The interface includes various interactive elements such as buttons, text areas, and dropdowns for user input and interaction.
- **Data Management**: Users can add, delete, and restore values. The data is stored and managed using JavaScript objects and arrays.
- **Export and Import**: The project supports exporting data to Excel files and importing data from CSV files.

### Usage:

1. **Input Values**: Users can input values using the provided text areas and buttons.
2. **Manage Data**: Users can add, delete, and restore values using the interface.
3. **Export Data**: Users can export the data to an Excel file by clicking the export button.
4. **Import Data**: Users can import data from a CSV file using the file input.

This project provides a comprehensive tool for performing AHP analysis with a user-friendly web interface.
